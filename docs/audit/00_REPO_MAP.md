# Repo Map — Kibray

This file is an autogenerated starting inventory of the repository structure and key entry points for the audit. It will be expanded during the audit to include explicit file:line references.

Top-level apps and areas:

- core/ — Django app with models, views, serializers, management commands, tests and templates.
  - models.py — domain models (Project, Task, TimeEntry, Expense, Income, etc.)
  - api/ — REST API serializers and views
  - management/commands/ — various maintenance and seed scripts
  - tests/ — unit and integration tests used by pytest
  - templates/ — Django templates used by server-rendered pages

- kibray_backend/ — Django project configuration (settings, urls, wsgi, asgi)
- frontend/ — client application (Vite, TypeScript). Entry: `frontend/src/` and `index.html`.
- locale/ — i18n message files (en, es)
- scripts/ — helper scripts for repo maintenance
- reports/ — generated audit reports (coverage, bandit, pip_audit, secrets, etc.)

Key commands:

- `python manage.py check` — Django system checks
- `pytest` — test suite
- `pip-audit -r requirements.txt` — dependency scan
- `detect-secrets scan --all-files` — secrets scan

Next steps: PHASE 0 will produce Makefile and CI workflow; PHASE 1 will parse the clarifications document and produce traceability outputs.
