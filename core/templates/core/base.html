{#
  COMPAT WRAPPER (modern-only)

  Compatibility wrapper around `core/base_modern.html`.
  We no longer rely on templates extending this, but keeping it around as a
  minimal shim is harmless and avoids surprises if an old template path
  reappears.

  Keep this file minimal: no markup, no scripts, no blocks.
